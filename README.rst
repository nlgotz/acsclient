ACSClient
==========

ACSClient is a Python wrapper for accessing a Cisco ACS server. I only have
access to a Cisco ACS 5.6 Server, so any previous or future ACS versions may not
work with this package.

Note: All functionality has been tested on Cisco ACS 5.8 Server

Install
-------
ACSClient should work with both Python2 and Python3


Python2 Install from pip::

    pip install acsclient

Python3 Install from pip3::

    pip3 install acsclient

Or you can run build this locally::

    git clone https://github.com/nlgotz/acsclient.git
    python setup.py install



How to Use
----------

Example::

    if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
        from acsclient.acsclient import ACSClient
        acs = ACSClient("192.168.1.11", "api", "password123", True)
    else:
        import acsclient
        acs = acsclient.ACSClient("192.168.1.11", "api", "password123", True)

    #Read all Devices
    r = acs.read("NetworkDevice/Device")
    print r.content

    #Read Specific Device
    r = acs.read("NetworkDevice/Device", "name", "ROUTER01")
    print r.content

    #Create new Device
    groups = [
            {"name": "All Locations:Site", "type": "Location"},
            {"name": "All Device Types:My Device", "type": "Device Type"},
            {"name": "CO:My Co", "type": "Company"},
    ]
    r = acs.create_tacacs_device("ROUTER02", groups, "s3cr37", "10.1.1.1")

    #Search TACACS
    r = acs.search_tacacs("NetworkDevice/Device", "ipAddress", "1.1.1.1", "EQUALS")
